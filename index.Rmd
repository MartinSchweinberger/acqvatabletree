## Timeline {-}

**Part 1: Introduction (10:00 - 10:10)**

**Part 2: Working with tables in R (10:10 - 12:00)**

Break (12:00 - 13:00)

**Part 3: Tree-based models (13:00 - 14:30)**

This workshop consists of two parts and it is aimed at beginners and intermediate users of R.

Part 2 showcases how to work with and process tabulated data (tables) using R and part 3 focuses on tree-based methods. Part 2 is decidedly practical while part 3 is more focused on discussing the advantages and disadvantages of these methods (while also showing how they can be implemented).
