## Timeline

**Part 1: Working with tables in R (10-12:00)**

Break (12:00 - 13:00)

**Part 2: Tree-based models (13:00-14:30)**

This workshop consists of two parts and it is aimed at beginners and intermediate users of R.

Part 1 showcases how to work with and process tabulated data (tables) using R and part 2 focuses on tree-based methods. Part 1 is decidedly practical while part 2 is more focused on discussing the advantages and disadvantages of these methods (while also showing how they can be implemented).
